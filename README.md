## Changes in the new 1.2.5 version

Added full ajax support to OData queries. Now you can put several independent grids in the same page that update and query with ajax. Added defaul blocking animation to all Html ajax operatioons.

## Roadmap

### Other features to come:

* json file with specs of classes to be compiled from C# to TypeScript. Some C# data annotations will be translated into MetaData JavaScript objects, so client side frameworks like angular or knockout may use the same C# classes, with the same validation rules.  Compilation may come in different "flavors" in such a way to adapt the code to various client frameworks.
* TagHelpers providers for all most common client side frameworks.
* TypeScript version of IQueryables, DContexts, and DbSets, with changes tracking cababilities and with the possibility 
to synchronize entities with various data sources (both local, and remote). 
* Several more complex controls, like TreeViews, enahnced with native Drag/Drop capabilities (or polyfills). 
* Advanced interaction protocols and widgets based on native drag and drop.
