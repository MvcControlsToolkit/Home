## Roadmap

### Other features to come:

* json file with specs of classes to be compiled from C# to TypeScript. Some C# data annotations will be translated into MetaData JavaScript objects, so client side frameworks like angular or knockout may use the same C# classes, with the same validation rules.  Compilation may come in different "flavors" in such a way to adapt the code to various client frameworks.
* TagHelpers providers for all most common client side frameworks.
* TypeScript version of IQueryables, DContexts, and DbSets, with changes tracking cababilities and with the possibility 
to synchronize entities with various data sources (both local, and remote). 
* Several more complex controls, like TreeViews, enahnced with native Drag/Drop capabilities (or polyfills). 
* Advanced interaction protocols and widgets based on native drag and drop.
