## Roadmap
    
Next version will include easy to use, out-of-the box filtering and sorting OData compatible capabilities you may apply easily to grids
or to your custom pages. 

    
Other features to come:

* json file with specs of classes to be compiled from C# to TypeScript. Some C# data annotations will be translated into MetaData JavaScript objects, so client side frameworks like angular or knockout may use the same C# classes, with the same validation rules.  Compilation may come in different "flavors" in such a way to adapt the code to various client frameworks.
* TagHelpers providers for all most common client side frameworks.
* TypeScript version of IQueryables, DContexts, and DbSets, with changes tracking cababilities and with the possibility 
to synchronize entities with various data sources (both local, and remote). Some of these feature will be available 
only on the commercial version.
* Several more complex controls, like TreeViews, enahnced with native Drag/Drop capabilities (or polyfills). 
 Some features will be available just on the commercial version.
* Advanced interaction protocols and widgets based on native drag and drop (commercial version only).
